* Q1 Bisection method

* Q2 

* Q3 token = ['1', '[', '2', '[', '3', '4', '5', ']', '6', '[', '7', '8', '[', '9', ']', '10', '[', '11', '12', ']', ']', '13', ']']

Seen token as a tree and every number behind '[' is the parent of the number benhind next '[', so the main tree parent node is '1' and the second layer parent nodes is '2' '6' '10'

* Optimal binning algorithm using dynamic programming

Error Sum of Squares (SSE)

SSE is the sum of the squared differences between each observation and its group's mean. It can be used as a measure of variation within a cluster. If all cases within a cluster are identical the SSE would then be equal to 0.

The formula for SSE is:
